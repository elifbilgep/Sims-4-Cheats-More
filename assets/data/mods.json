This mod is a collection of smaller mods that give you the power to make small adjustments and tweaks to how sims live their lives. Don’t like a particular item of clothing? You can blacklist it. Is an NPC interaction annoying you? Take control of that NPC and change it. This mod also comes with story-progression mechanics which has been dearly missed since The Sims 3.",
